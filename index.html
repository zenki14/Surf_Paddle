					<p>I believe whatever doesn't kill you simply makes you... stranger. Never underestimate Gotham City. People get mugged coming home from work every day of the week. Sometimes things just go bad. But it's not who you are underneath... it's what you do that defines you.</p>
					<p>Introduce a little anarchy, upset the established order and everything becomes chaos. I'm an agent of chaos. Oh, and you know the thing about chaos? It's fair.</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>WHOA, THAT'S RADICAL!</p>

					<p>You wanna know how I got them? So I had a wife. She was beautiful, like you, who tells me I worry too much, who tells me I ought to smile more, who gambles and gets in deep with the sharks. Hey. One day they carve her face. And we have no money for surgeries. She can't take it. I just wanna see her smile again. I just want her to know that I don't care about the scars. So, I do this to myself. And you know what? She can't stand the sight of me. She leaves. Now I see the funny side. Now I'm always smiling.</p>
					<p>Ooh, you think darkness is your ally? You merely adopted the dark, I was born in it. Molded by it. I didn't see the light until I was already a man. By then there was nothing to be but blinded.</p>
